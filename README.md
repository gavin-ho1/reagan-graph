Downloaded table #2 from [census.gov](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-people.html) as `hstpov2.xlsx`

Downloaded table #6 from [census.gov](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-people.html) as `hstpov6.xlsx`


Both files were then converted to csv with the same name but with the csv file extension
This is a graphed version of that data 

There is an annotated version and non-annotated version for each graph
