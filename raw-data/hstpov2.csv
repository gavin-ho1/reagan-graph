"Note: Before 1979, unrelated subfamilies were included in all families. Beginning in 1979, unrelated subfamilies are excluded from all families. An unrelated subfamily is defined as a married couple family with or without children or a single parent with one or more own, never-married, children under the age of 18 living in a household and not related by birth, marriage or adoption to the householder.",,,,,,,,,,,,
